#Types of Supervised Algorithms

 Regression Algorithms (predict continuous values)

Linear Regression – predicts a straight-line relationship between variables.

Polynomial Regression – captures non-linear relationships.

Ridge/Lasso Regression – regularized versions to reduce overfitting.

Support Vector Regression (SVR) – uses support vectors to predict continuous values.

Decision Tree Regressors – tree-based prediction of numeric outcomes.

Random Forest Regressors – ensemble of decision trees for robust regression.

Gradient Boosted Regression (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).

Classification Algorithms (predict discrete classes)

Logistic Regression – for binary or multi-class classification.

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) – predicts based on closest neighbors.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) – finds hyperplanes separating classes.

Decision Trees – tree-based rules to classify.

Random Forest Classifiers – ensemble of trees for better accuracy.

Gradient Boosted Trees – sequential tree-based models.

Naïve Bayes – probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem.

Neural Networks – can classify complex patterns (deep learning).
